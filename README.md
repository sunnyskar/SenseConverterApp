<h3 align="center">Sensivity Convertor App</h3>

  <p align="center">
        We want to create an App to be able to convert mouse sensitivity between two games. The App will facilitate
    aiming consistency between games by giving players a sensitivity that they are used to based on games they already play. There are websites that do this but this app will be optimized for the iPhone/iOS platform. Our goal is to publish this onto the appstore.
